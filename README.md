# Greetings 👋
### This is a simple game called <strong>Guess a Number</strong>

<p>In which your opponent <b>"the computer"</b> chooses a random number between <b>"1 and 100"</b> and your task is to guess this number.
After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number.</p>

<p>This game I wrote without any engines from scratch.</p>
<p>Using <b>Java</b> & <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> only.</p>
